# ESE527 Project

Project name: Prediction of Building Energy Usage

Team name: No. 0

Team members: Yuchen Zhang and Xinyu Gu

Some Important Notes:

### 1. About Datasets

Since the original datasets are too large, we are unable to upload it to repository. 

Instead, we upload the preprocessed datasets, which are located in the folder 'Processed_Dataset.zip'.

The original datasets can be found on Kaggle.

API: kaggle competitions download -c ashrae-energy-prediction

### 2. To Find Different Modeling Stages

1. Data Loading: loading_dataset.R

2. Pre-processing (outlier detection): preprocessing1_outlierDetection.R, preProcessing2.py

3. Model training including feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning: Model Training.py

4. Model Performance including Cross validation technique implemented: Model Training.py

5. Final results: N/A
